#📊 FreshMart Sales Insights Dashboard

I'm thrilled to share my latest analytics project — a fully dynamic and interactive Sales Dashboard for FreshMart Store, developed using Microsoft Excel.
This dashboard transforms raw transactional data into an insight-driven analytical tool, enabling business users to explore performance across products, locations, and delivery metrics — all in real time.

##✨ Project Overview

This Excel dashboard goes beyond static reports — it’s a live, responsive tool for decision-making.
Every metric, chart, and visual dynamically updates through slicers, allowing users to filter by Month, Weekday, Source of Customer, and Slot Time.
